                    <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">The shades were closed keeping the room dark. Peter knew that he should open them and let in the sunlight 
                        so he could begin the day, but he didn't have the energy or willpower. Nothing had gone as expected the 
                        day before and he no longer wanted to spend the energy to begin a new day. He stared at the shades 
                        wondering if there was a way to disappear from the reality of the world for the rest of the day.</p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">She didn't like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and started the tantrum 
                            he knew was coming. But this time was different. Instead of trying to placate her and her 
                            unreasonable demands, he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word.</p></i>

                    <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. 
                        Bounding down the steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic.</p> 
                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down. 
                            Had he past them without seeing them? It didn't seem possible. 
                            He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body.</p></i>

                    <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">There wasn't a bird in the sky, but that was not what caught her attention. It was the clouds. 
                        The deep green that isn't the color of clouds, but came with these.
                         She knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared.</p>
                         <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">They told her that this was her once chance to show the world 
                             what she was made of. She believed them at the time. It was the 
                             big stage and she knew the world would be there to see. The only 
                             one who had disagreed with this sentiment was her brother. He had 
                             told her that you don't show the world what you're made of when they 
                             are all watching,you show that in your actions when nobody was looking. 
                             It was looking more and more like her brother was correct.</p></i>

                         options, but he didn't let them enter his mind. It was done and that was 
                         that. It was just the way it had to be.</p>

                             the five Venusians, very much startled, looked overhead. They 
                             were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore 
                             before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which 
                             bore the mystifying information "Pepsi-Cola."</p></i>
