        <h2><a id="section1" class="title-row">My University Life</a></h2>
        <p>It has been amazing. I have learned and experienced so many new things in such a short period of time, and it has gone by so fast. I am still discovering all the opportunities that university offers me.
            
        </p>
        <p>My classes are great and I enjoy every one of them, especially IWP. The depth and detail of what we are leaning is far beyond my high school experience. It is just amazing to see how the same layout can be executed in som many different ways</p>
        <h3><a id="section2" class="title-row">Finding What Challenges Me</a></h3>
        <p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaVBDPAy-SI" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaVBDPAy-SI', 'interview']);" target="_blank">interview</a>, Neil deGrasse Tyson talks about science
          boosting the economy. He goes on to say, most companies and politicians don’t have the tolerance for the long term view.</p>
        <p>You don’t motivate a group of kids, saying “Who wants to be a mechanical engineer and help improve flight efficiency by 15% compared to the airplane your father flew?”</p>
        <p>But instead, ask “Who wants to be an engineer and help develop airfoils to help fly in the atmosphere of Mars?” With the latter, you get the best students in the class.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Flow is the intersection of what you are good at and what challenges you— where difficulty and competency meet.</p>
          <p>When your competency exceeds the difficulty of a task, you are bored. And when the difficulty exceeds your competency, you are anxious. That was my problem: I was bored.</p>
          <p>— Jeff Goins, <a href="http://amzn.to/28INctw" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://amzn.to/28INctw', 'The Art of Work']);" target="_blank">The Art of Work</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There are times when it gets kind of repetitive and boring. That’s fine. We can’t always have constant excitement. It’s called "the most formative phase in the life of a person" for a reason.</p>
        <p><h3 id="section3">Inspiration</h3>
        <p>For inspiration, this is one of the reasons that I have extracirriculars. To keep pushing my limits. It allows me to explore. To find out how far I can go, how much pressure I can handle, and how well I can manage my time.</p>
